Assignment Description: Building a portfolio page that includes information about me, contact and work. 

Starter code: https://github.com/Cocho011/advancedcss_portfolio_page/blob/ceff86874cd31601a2053102914e1e3d0ee43b0d/advcssportfolio.html

Screenshot path: advancedcss_portfolio_page/assets/module.1.challenge.portfolio.screenshot.png. Also added the screenshot to assets folder.

Note: Most application links all function correctly. HTML and CSS properties need further consolidation and organization.
